        is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. This
        format description is for HTML 5, standardized in two coordinated efforts. One is by the Web Hypertext Application
        Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which maintains a specification for HTML as a modularized "living standard" at
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/. The second is at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A series of snapshots of
        well-supported modules have been compiled and published as W3C Recommendations: 5.0 (2014); 5.1 (2016); 5.2 (2017). The
        latest W3C Recommendation is a result of a May 2019 agreement between W3C and the WHATWG regarding the development of a
        single version of the HTML specification. The specifics of the agreement can be found here and the latest
        recommendations for HTML can be found at the https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/. See Notes below for more on the
        relationship between W3C and WHATWG.
